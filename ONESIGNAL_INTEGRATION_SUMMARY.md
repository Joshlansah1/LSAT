# 🔔 OneSignal Integration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Enabled OneSignal in Code
- **File**: `src/lib/notifications.js`
- **Change**: Uncommented initialization code
- **Status**: ACTIVE - OneSignal will initialize when app loads

### 2. ✅ Added User Tagging
- **File**: `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`
- **What**: Auto-sends user data to OneSignal for personalized notifications
- **Tags Sent**:
  - `user_name`: "Geraudia"
  - `current_streak`: "7" (updates automatically)
  - `last_study_date`: "2024-10-12" (updates automatically)
  - `total_hours`: "45.5" (updates automatically)
  - `streak_level`: "consistent" (beginner/consistent/master)
  - `has_logged_today`: "true" (updates automatically)

### 3. ✅ Created Documentation
- **ONESIGNAL_QUICKSTART.md**: 10-minute setup guide (START HERE!)
- **ONESIGNAL_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive documentation with all features

## How It Works

### When User Opens App:
1. OneSignal initializes
2. Welcome notification prompt appears
3. If user allows → subscribed to notifications
4. User ID and tags are sent to OneSignal
5. Ready to receive notifications!

### When User Logs Study Hours:
1. Tags are automatically updated:
   - `current_streak` updates
   - `last_study_date` updates to today
   - `total_hours` increases
   - `has_logged_today` becomes "true"
2. OneSignal can use these tags for smart delivery

### Daily at 5pm Ghana Time:
1. OneSignal sends automated notification
2. Works even if app is closed (on iPhone with iOS 16.4+)
3. Can be configured to only send if `has_logged_today` is "false"

```

**Audience Filter**:
- Tag: `has_logged_today` `equals` `false`

Don't lose your {{tags.current_streak}} day streak! Log your hours now! 🔥
```

### Example 3: Milestone Celebrations
**Audience Filter**:
- Tag: `current_streak` `equals` `7` (or 14, 30, 100)

```

### Example 4: Beginner Encouragement
