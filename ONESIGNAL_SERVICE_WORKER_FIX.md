# 🔧 OneSignal Service Worker Fix

## Issue Fixed
The service worker was trying to import the wrong script. This has been corrected.

## What Changed
- ✅ `public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` - Now imports correct service worker script
- ✅ `src/lib/notifications.js` - Prevents double initialization

## 🚀 How to Fix in Browser (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Clear Old Service Workers
1. **Open your browser** at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5174`
2. **Open DevTools** (Press F12)
3. **Go to Application tab** (top menu)
4. **Click "Service Workers"** (left sidebar under "Application")
5. **Click "Unregister"** on ALL OneSignal service workers
6. **Close DevTools**

### Step 2: Hard Refresh
1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)
2. This clears cache and reloads everything

### Step 3: Test Again
1. **Watch the console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. You should see: `✅ OneSignal initialized successfully`
3. **Notification prompt** should appear
4. **Click "Allow"**

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### In Console (F12):
```
✅ OneSignal initialized successfully
```

### You Should See:
- A notification permission prompt sliding down from top
- OR a browser dialog asking to allow notifications

### You Should NOT See:
- ❌ "Failed to execute 'importScripts'"
- ❌ "ServiceWorker script evaluation failed"
- ❌ "SDK already initialized" (should only show once if at all)

---

## 🐛 If Still Having Issues

### Clear Everything and Start Fresh:

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Application tab** → **Storage** (left sidebar)
3. **Click "Clear site data"** button
4. **Check all boxes** and click "Clear site data"
5. **Close and reopen browser**
6. **Go back to** `http://localhost:5173` or `5174`

### Or Use Incognito/Private Window:
- This bypasses all cached service workers
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+N** (Chrome) or **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Firefox)
- Go to your localhost URL
- Test notifications there

## 📋 Summary of All Fixes

### Files Updated:
1. ✅ `public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` - Correct script import
2. ✅ `src/lib/notifications.js` - Script load tracking to prevent duplicates

### What Was Wrong:
- Service worker was importing `OneSignalSDK.page.js` (wrong)
- Should import `OneSignalSDK.sw.js` (correct)
- Script was loading multiple times causing "SDK already initialized"

### What's Fixed:
- ✅ Service worker imports correct script
- ✅ SDK only loads once
- ✅ No duplicate initialization errors
