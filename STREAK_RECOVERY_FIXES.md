# ✅ Streak Recovery System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Recovery Button Showing When Shouldn't
**Problem**: Recovery button appeared even when streak was 0 from the start (no broken streak)

**Solution**: 
- Added `streakIsBroken` check that verifies:
  - User has study logs
  - Current streak is 0
  - Most recent log is MORE than 1 day old (meaning streak actually broke)
- Button only shows when streak was active and then broken

**Code Location**: `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` lines 61-70

```javascript
const streakIsBroken = logs && logs.length > 0 && (() => {
  const sortedLogs = [...logs].sort((a, b) => 
    new Date(b.study_date) - new Date(a.study_date)
  );
  const mostRecentDate = new Date(sortedLogs[0].study_date);
  const yesterday = new Date();
  yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
  yesterday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  mostRecentDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  return mostRecentDate < yesterday;
})();
```

### 2. ❌ Closing Modal Decreases Attempts
**Problem**: Simply closing the recovery modal (without attempting quiz) decreased recovery attempts

**Solution**:
- Changed `handleRecoveryClose` to NOT deduct attempts
- Added `handleRecoveryFailed` for when quiz is actually attempted and failed
- Only deducts attempt when:
  - Quiz is completed successfully → `onSuccess` → deducts 1
  - Quiz is completed but failed → `onFail` → deducts 1
  - Modal is just closed → `onClose` → no deduction

**Code Location**: 
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx` lines 92-107
- `src/features/streak/StreakRecoveryQuiz.jsx` lines 142-159

### 3. ❌ Streak Showing 0 Despite Having Logs
**Problem**: User logged study hours for multiple days but streak shows 0

**Debugging Added**:
- Comprehensive console logging in `calculateStreak` function
- Shows:
  - 📊 Received logs
  - 📅 Today's date
  - 📅 Yesterday's date
  - 📅 Most recent log date
  - 📅 All study dates
  - 🔍 Step-by-step date matching
  - 🏆 Final streak result

**To Debug**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages with emojis (🔥, 📊, 📅, etc.)
4. Check if:
   - Study dates are in correct format
   - Date comparisons are working
   - Any date mismatches

**Common Causes**:
- Timezone differences (dates stored in UTC but compared in local time)
- Date format inconsistencies
- Most recent log is actually 2+ days old

**Code Location**: `src/utils/streakUtils.js` lines 1-82

## How Streak Recovery Now Works

1. **User has active streak** → Studying daily ✅
2. **User misses a day** → Streak breaks 💔
3. **Recovery button appears** (only if streak was broken, not if it was never active)
4. **User clicks "Recover Streak"** → Opens quiz modal
5. **Options**:
   - **Close modal** → No attempt used, can try later
   - **Complete quiz successfully (2/3 correct)** → Streak recovered! ✅ (1 attempt used)
   - **Complete quiz but fail** → Streak not recovered ❌ (1 attempt used)
6. **3 attempts total** → After 3 failed attempts, no more recovery possible

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify recovery button ONLY shows when streak is actually broken
- [ ] Close modal without taking quiz → attempts remain the same
- [ ] Take quiz and pass → streak recovers, attempts decrease by 1
- [ ] Take quiz and fail → no recovery, attempts decrease by 1
- [ ] Check console for streak calculation debug logs
- [ ] Verify streak counts correctly for consecutive days

## Next Steps

If streak is still showing 0:
1. Check console logs for "=== STREAK CALCULATION DEBUG ==="
2. Share the output showing:
   - What dates are in the database
   - What today's date is calculated as
   - Why the streak calculation is returning 0
