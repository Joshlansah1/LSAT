# Issues Fixed - Summary

## All 6 Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. ✅ Modal Close on Outside Click - FIXED
**Problem**: Modal didn't close when clicking outside/backdrop  
**Solution**: 
- Added `onClick` handler to modal wrapper div
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to modal content to prevent event bubbling
- Now clicking outside the modal properly closes it

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/Modal.jsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Prevent Duplicate Study Logs - FIXED
**Problem**: User could log multiple entries for the same day  
**Solution**:
- Changed `hasLoggedToday` to find actual log (`todaysLog`)
- Created `handleLogButtonClick()` that checks if log exists
- If log exists for today → Opens in **edit mode** automatically
- If no log → Opens in **create mode**
- User can only edit after logging, no duplicates possible

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx`

**How it works**:
```javascript
const todaysLog = logs?.find((log) => log.study_date === today);
if (hasLoggedToday && todaysLog) {
  setEditingLog(todaysLog); // Edit mode
} else {
  setEditingLog(null); // Create mode
}
```

### 3. ✅ Toast Notification Background - FIXED
**Problem**: Toast messages had no background, text was hard to read  
**Solution**:
- Added solid background colors for all toast types
- **Default**: White background (#ffffff) with dark text
- **Success**: Light green background (#f0fdf4) with dark green text
- **Error**: Light red background (#fef2f2) with dark red text
- Added box shadows for depth
- Added proper borders for definition

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.jsx`

**Visual Result**:
- ✅ Success toasts: Green background with check icon
- ❌ Error toasts: Red background with X icon
- 💬 Default toasts: White background, fully readable
